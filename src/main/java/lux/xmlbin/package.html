<h1>xmlbin</h1>
<p>
A fast, reasonably compact, parse-free, recursive format for XML data.
</p>
<p>
fast - for what?  XPath eval, and I/O

compact - not much different from text XML

recursive - so that elements can be chopped out as results, but no need for
modification otherwise.  Could leave some dangling out-of-bounds
references.
</p>
<p>
  Namespace-awareness can be controlled independently by the document and
  by the processor.  If a namespace-aware document is encountered by a
  namespace-unaware processor, the processor becomes namespace-aware.  If
  an aware processor encounters an unaware document, it applies an identity
  prefix->namespace URI mapping in order to make the document become aware.
