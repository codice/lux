* optimizations
** basic indexing support: qname retrieval speeds queries when the names are selective
** count() is optimized for a special case:
when the query for the argument can be shown to have the same cardinality;
basically this is when the argument is a simple path expression equivalent
to these forms:

//element/root()
//element/ancestor::document-node()
(/)[.//element]

etc..
*** also in that case, when not counting (just returning documents),
we save some time by not executing the xpath.
** exist(), empty()
short-circuit eval
** count(//a) + count(//b)
** lazy result iteration
Rather than trying to figure out in advance how many results will be
required, allow the caller to pull results lazily.  Test this with exists()
and empty(), and with count() > N.  Yaah this seems fraught with peril -
see NOTES. No it works! And it's not that hard.
