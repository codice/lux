* optimizations
** basic indexing support: qname retrieval speeds queries when the names are selective
** count() is optimized for a special case:
when the query for the argument can be shown to have the same cardinality;
basically this is when the argument is a simple path expression equivalent
to these forms:

//element/root()
//element/ancestor::document-node()
(/)[.//element]

etc..
*** also in that case, when not counting (just returning documents),
we save some time by not executing the xpath.
** exist(), empty()
short-circuit eval
** count(//a) + count(//b)
* lux components
** Translator
converts Saxon's internal Expression tree to a Lux AbstractExpression tree.
** PathOptimizer
optimizes an AbstractExpression tree using Lucene searches with element and
attribute name indexes.
*** ExpressionVisitor
machinery for optimizers and other tree visitors like UnOptimizer.
** Indexer
