3/10; first implementation w/Jaxen and Saxon; used a global optimization,
attempting to generate one single query per expression, and used a special
lucene collector.  Limitations of this became quickly apparent

4/04; developed translator as precursor to generating sub-expression queries
using a function.

4/11; a name-query optimizer beginning to take shape

4/22; optimizer working well, but need for lazy eval becomes apparent

4/23 - 4/25; switch to lazy evaluation

4/25-4/30; tightening up various optimizations

4/31-5/9; path indexing implemented and working

5/10-5/13; solr components working again (broken by switch to lucene pull api); code cleanup

6/3; XQuery 1.0; XQTS 99% passing; API cleanup; Solr field autoconfig;
PubFactory sandbox testing

7/5: value and word indexes

UPCOMING

****** bug fixes, testing (namespaces / attributes)

****** package and RELEASE 0.9 to ifactory
