# Lux 1.0.1

Release 1.0.1 crosses a major version milestone.  We did this more to remark
on its level of robustness and maturity, rather than any specific feature
milestone, but also because, with the addition of configurable analysis,
Lux now includes a pretty complete set of XML search engine features.

What happened to 1.0.0?  Well we could tell you some malarky about XPath
sequences counting from 1, not 0, but the truth is a bug slipped in, as
they will, and 1.0.0 was not released. Stuff happens and we move on.
