1) unit tests all pass
2) review outstanding issues.  any blockers? fix them and go back to 1
3) remove -SNAPSHOT from version in pom.xml
4) follow instructions in BUILDING. any failures? back to step 1 :)
   build binary assemblies; smoke test by:
   unpacking, running (./lux, or ./lux.bat) and running integration test
   in lux-appserver (mvn verify), or run demo, import shakespeare and search
4a) test installation in existing Solr (ifpress)
4b) write release notes, describing new work.  open issues are covered in the bug tracker
5) commit and tag the head revision (as lux-${version}) in version control and push
   git commit
   git tag -a v0.6 -m 'lux version 0.6'
   git push origin master
   git push origin v0.6
8) post binary files to luxdb.org
9) deploy to maven central:
# this never did work?  Maybe it was just lacking the -Pmaven-deploy,
# which includes the gpg instructions
# mvn deploy -Dgpg.passhprase=xxxxxxx
mvn -Pmaven-deploy verify
cd target
jar -cvf bundle.jar lux-*.jar lux-*.asc
# go to https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#stagingRepositories
# Staging Upload / Artifact Bundle

9a) increment the version in pom.xml to the next -SNAPSHOT

10) generate luxdb.org 
  mvn javadoc:javadoc
  cd doc
  jekyll build
