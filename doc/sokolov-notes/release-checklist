1) unit tests all pass
2) review outstanding issues.  any blockers? fix them and go back to 1
3) remove -SNAPSHOT from version in pom.xml
4) follow instructions in BUILDING. any failures? back to step 1 :)
   build binary assemblies; smoke test by:
   unpacking, running (./lux, or ./lux.bat) and running integration test
   in lux-appserver (mvn verify), or run demo, import shakespeare and search
4a) test installation in existing Solr (ifpress)
5) commit and tag the head revision (as lux-${version}) in version control and push
   git commit
   git tag -a v0.6 -m 'lux version 0.6'
   git push
6) increment the version in pom.xml to the next -SNAPSHOT
7) write release notes, describing new work.  open issues are covered in the bug tracker
8) post binary files
