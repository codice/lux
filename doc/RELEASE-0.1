We have a working XPath/Solr/Lucene integration that allows you to query
using XPath against xml stored in a lucene index.  

At its heart is an extension of org.jaxen.XPath, LuXPath (TBD:
net.lux.XPath?). Passing a QueryContext (which accepts a Lucene Query)
causes the XPath to be evaluated against all documents which match the
query.

The Solr integration consists of a QParserPlugin, UpdateProcessor and
SearchHandler/Component. This integration is not formally complete, but
some important implementation details remain.  Namely, pagination and
offset calculations need to be done, and this is complicated by the need to
map between document counts and XPath result counts.  We plan to provide
paging on XPath results; currently you can request the first N results
only.

Optimizations.

An attempt is made to retrieve only documents that will match the XPath.
For now this is done using QName indexes only.
