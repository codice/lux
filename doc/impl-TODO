* test optimizations
** not() 
** node-uri(), document-uri()
** pagination
optimize subsequence
short-circuit evaluations, etc.
*** optimize pagination when we know that #count=#estimate
eg where a sequence will always return one result per document, and we know
that we can match the documents exactly by query.  For example:
**** /descendant::foo[1] or /descendant::foo[last()]
If we had accurate element counts/positions we could extend this to any
constant expression in the predicate.  Also expressions with position() =
same
