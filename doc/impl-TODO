* word index followthrough
** single fulltext field
Change to using single fulltext field with terms that incorporate the field
name so we can do near queries across different element names, and
implement transparent elements (like ML phrase-through).
*** create QNameTextTokenStream
returned by QNameTextField
each token 
** user search function
Supporting full text queries; we do have lux:search (xs:string); however
the query syntax is bizarre since you must specify an element name for
every token using lux_node_ELTNAME: and the syntax for namespaces is long
(no prefixes).  Conversely we have lux:search (element()), but no xquery
helper functions for constructing the queries.  However that seems to be
the way to go.
** full text search *across the whole document*
** full text search *spanning all descendants*
** full text search *excluding some descendants*
** query constructors
** test multiword queries
** test queries in complex path relations
* performance testing
* new indexes
** directory (uri component) index
also link to collection()?
** sorting
** fragmentation 
use Lucene's block join indexing
* bugs
** visit(Dot) has possibly incorrect resultType (DOCUMENT)
** standard function library untested
A bunch of functions are untested.  We don't know if we're doing the right
thing in terms of query generation based on their args.  See
PathOptimizer.fnArgParity
** failure to optimize deep path query properly
see the expression in SearchTest.testTrailingStringCall - it ends up
including some booleans instead of all paths
** don't use schema.xml and solrconfig.xml as test data !
When we change them our tests break!
* missing features
** raise exception when query parse fails
this is currently getting swallowed internally and only printed to stderr
** support for full set of atomic types
The main thing missing is marshalling results from Solr
** namespace support (in indexes)
This might be working, but we need to test
** attribute index support
This might be working, but we need to test
* api design / cleanup
** parseable query
rename and consolidate naming of subclasses
** remove these notes from the release
** make clean package dependencies 
*** fill out the generic API
*** put all the Saxon-specific code in a package
* better tests generally
**  Object lifecycle
Saxon currently holds the DocIdAllocator and CachingDocReader, but these
should really be an object with query life-span.  Make sure that long-lived
objects stay in Evaluator (Saxon) and short-lived ones in Context
(SaxonContext).
** search test2
refactor and merge w/search test - check opto facts against actual behavior
** search test all index types
include name-index only test
** solr search handler coverage
test all atomic result types
* optimization ideas
There are a few more things we can optimize using the "basic" indexing setup
** count(collection())
** optimize not(empty(X)) -> exists(X), and not(exists(X)) -> empty(X)
** simplify some path queries
Sometimes we generate a query like 
w(w(w({},\"PLAY\"),\"PERSONAE\" OR \"ACT\"),\"TITLE\")
instead of
w({},\"PLAY\",(\"ACT\" OR \"PERSONAE\"),\"TITLE\")
Is the second one actually better?
** optimize the Optimizer 
It currently generates an entire translated expression tree for every
subtree it attempts to optimize so that we can figure out if that subtree
is ordered or not.  We could possibly cache a translated tree and walk it
in parallel?  Or link subexpressions to it with some kind of map?
** Path indexes random idea
What if instead of collapsing all the paths down so we only store unique
paths, we retained the document structure in some way by listing *all*
paths?  What would that buy?  numerical predicates?
** pre-evaluate some functions, like aggregates:

In cases where we can do this (argument expression is evaluated in the
QueryContext, ie there is no current node, or the argument is the
collection() function), rewrite/wrap/intercept the function to an internal
method (lux:count) that we implement by recursing into a nested query/eval.

Perform static analysis of the argument expression(s) to see if they can be
retrieved minimally by query.  If we can prove that the db query result
count will equal the expression result count, then we can replace the
count() expression with an (indexed, more efficient) query-count()
expression.  exists() and not() can be computed as count()>0 and count()=0,
and we can short-circuit evaluation in the result collector.

This could also hold for max/min when we have an appropriate field.  Maybe
we can even help out w/aggregates like sum/avg?

More complex would be something like: count(//a) + count(//b) ?

*** root()
*** count()
across multiple documents
*** node-uri(), document-uri()
** optimize pagination when we know that #count=#estimate
optimize subsequence when we can - eg the first arg, the sequence, is
entirely indexed.  And even when it's not, make sure we don't iterate on
beyond where we need to - asserting the results are sorted properly.  We're
somewhat limited in our ability to do this right now since we rely on Saxon
to make judgements about sorting, and it doesn't always optimize as
agressively as we would like, at least not in the saxon-HE version.  It
works in some simple cases, though.
* cleanup
** delete dead code
*** get rid of lux:search facts argument
The facts are not serving any purpose now that we are using lazy
evaluation, and we have separate lux:count and lux:exists methods.
** add pagination args to lux:search
This should help work around some of the shortcomings of Saxon's HE
optimizer (re: documentSort) and let us skip document retrieval for docs
prior to the starting doc.
* testing
** Test performance on XQTS with Saxon alone, and with Lux/Saxon
show impact of Lux on compilation speed
** develop an XQTS database query test
Ignore queries that use the emptydocument as input Run the other queries
against the entire test set as context: ie against the sequence of
documents that is collection(xqts) and then run using Lux.  Make sure the
results are consistent; compare timing.

I've done this, but it's hard to prove that we're getting the same results back since the order in 
which documents are returned from collection() seems to be a bit unpredictable in Saxon?

** test namespaces and attributes
queries w/namespaces and attributes have not been tested.
Try indexing and retrieving the reader-test documents
