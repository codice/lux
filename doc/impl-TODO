** distributed search (and indexing)
*** search
This is complicated b/c Saxon wants to pull results, and Solr, to push
them.  We had a similar issue in the single-node search with Lucene, but
managed to overcome by implementing our own pull-style Lucene searcher.
It's not truly pull-style when the results are sorted (by relevance score
or by value).  In that case we buffer the first N results (docids only),
and if more get pulled, we fetch the next batch.

In Solr Cloud, the RequestHandler orchestrates communication with a number
of shards, and with a list of SearchComponents.  It calls each component
once (distributedProcess()) in each phase.  Communication between these
components is mediated by the ResponseBuilder, which holds information
about the current state of the request.

Ultimately what we need to do is evaluate the xquery (control passes to
Saxon), and then when a search function is called, initiate the entire
distributed search process, following a similar procedure as we currently
do for sorted results in LuxSearcher: fetch the top N from each shard, and
repeat if needed.

This suggests tinkering with the RequestHandler.  XQueryComponent
can *call* RequestHandler.handleRequestBody and then return STAGE_DONE.
Now typically SearchComponents do not maintain a pointer to the handler
that owns them.  We maintain a (per-core) singleton, SolrIndexConfig, which
is available to the XQueryComponent via the core's plugin registry.
Probably we can grab onto the RequestHandler from there?  There can be
multiple request handlers though, and we want to make sure to use the same
one: so we can iterate over all the request handlers in the core, and
iterate over all the components in each handler until we find the one we're
attached to.  Alternatively we could subclass the RequestHandler and inform
the component (if it's an XQueryComponent)

*** test distributed search

*** test distributed indexing

I believe this should just work
** directory (uri component) index
also link to collection()?
** fragmentation 
use Lucene's block join indexing
** binary documents
I think this is working now - let's measure and document the improvement.
** execute app from index
* optimization
cache translated AbstractExpressions for indexed XPaths somewhere.
IndexConfiguration seems like the right place, but it doesn't have any
access to an XPathCompiler (nor a SaxonTranslator).  These are available to
XmlIndexer, Compiler, and (for the translator) PathOptimizer.
** not() optimization:
*** invert the query:
count(collection()[not(.//pubdate)])
  optimize as:
count(collection()) - count(collection()[.//pubdate])
*** optimize not(empty(X)) -> exists(X), and not(exists(X)) -> empty(X)
** handle variables in comparisons
at least if they're atomic?
** replace query stack
Store queries with the abstract expressions that generate them.  The stack
abstraction is opaque, and fragile.  To make it work we would need
something that enforces balanced pushing and popping.  Our convention is
that every expression pushes a single query and pops as many queries as it
has sub-expressions.  I spent a whole day tracking down a bug in the way we
were handling queries for FLWOR clauses, because they don't really fit the
stack model very well.
** optimize the Optimizer 
It currently generates an entire translated expression tree for every
subtree it attempts to optimize so that we can figure out if that subtree
is ordered or not.  We could possibly cache a translated tree and walk it
in parallel?  Or link subexpressions to it with some kind of map?
*** cache compiled (optimized) expressions
Where does such a cache belong?
** Path occurrence indexes 
Suppose that instead of phrases, we indexed all paths, as "keywords", ie
untokenized; the position would be the depth-first sequence, so like:

a a/b a/b/c a/b/c a/z a/z/@id 

except this has the real drawback that you are almost always interested in the *tail end*, so let's reverse: 

a b/a c/b/a c/b/a z/a @id/z/a

this lets you easily search for a full path, or a sub-path preceded by //,
which becomes a prefix query.

TermDocs iterates over term frequency per doc; with that it should be 

TermFreqValueSource counts term freq; use it in a FunctionQuery??

FunctionQuery creates an AllScorer; we would want it to use instead a 

Scorer like the one returned by FunctionValues.getRangeScorer

Solr FunctionRangeQuery does what we want using Solr's ValueSourceRangeFilter

so: new FunctionRangeQuery(new ValueSourceRangeFilter (new TermFreqValueSource (field, val, indexedField, indexedBytes), min, max, includemin, includemax))

(note field, val seem to be basically unused in TFVS? )

** pre-evaluate some functions, like aggregates:

In cases where we can do this (argument expression is evaluated in the
QueryContext, ie there is no current node, or the argument is the
collection() function), rewrite/wrap/intercept the function to an internal
method (lux:count) that we implement by recursing into a nested query/eval.

Perform static analysis of the argument expression(s) to see if they can be
retrieved minimally by query.  If we can prove that the db query result
count will equal the expression result count, then we can replace the
count() expression with an (indexed, more efficient) query-count()
expression.  exists() and not() can be computed as count()>0 and count()=0,
and we can short-circuit evaluation in the result collector.

This could also hold for max/min when we have an appropriate field.  Maybe
we can even help out w/aggregates like sum/avg?

More complex would be something like: count(//a) + count(//b) ?

*** root()
*** count()
across multiple documents
*** node-uri(), document-uri()
** optimize pagination when we know that #count=#estimate
optimize subsequence when we can - eg the first arg, the sequence, is
entirely indexed.  And even when it's not, make sure we don't iterate on
beyond where we need to - asserting the results are sorted properly.  We're
somewhat limited in our ability to do this right now since we rely on Saxon
to make judgements about sorting, and it doesn't always optimize as
agressively as we would like, at least not in the saxon-HE version.  It
works in some simple cases, though.
* app-server
** documentation review
** integration test
Enhance the integration test so it checks that the demo runs
** http header control
redirect, 404, error, etc
** passing current uri
We currently send Solr the translated path - so it can read the resource,
but it doesn't have the original url, which it would be nice to have so we
can give it to the application
* demo
* coverage 
SaxonTranslator: 85,87,90
** namespace lookup failure during document ordering analysis
check w/XQTS
** operators:
negate
** getTypeDescription 
with ?
** types
xs:hexBinary, xs:base64Binary, comment(), empty()
** variable binding to constant??
try w/XQTS
** override fn, local and xs namespace prefixes
** funky flwor expression with leading where clause?
see exprFor(FLWORExpression)
try w/XQTS
* performance evaluation
** tests
StressTest - compare w/ML, Solr, exist
** Compare indexing speed
** Compare query/eval speed
show impact of parsing, document retrieval?
** Test performance on XQTS with Saxon alone, and with Lux/Saxon
show impact of Lux on compilation speed We did this.  The overall slowdown
on XQTS is a bit depressing: running the entire test suite with Lux enabled
takes about 50% longer than without it.  However this seems largely to be
due to the effect of some tests which, when compiled, lead to expression
trees that are much larger than the original xquery form.  The rule of
thumb seems to be that you can expect compilation time to double.  In XQTS,
compilation time dominates the test (after simply loading test data).

* absolute path in function context
Saxon treats this as a compile-time error, so there's really not much we
can do about it short of introducing a different parser.
* compatibility w/vanilla Saxon
We'd like to be able to use Saxon PE/EE.  Currently if you use a licensed
Configuration, you lose out on some nice performance optimizations for some
queries that search large numbers of documents.
** purchase Saxon-PE
** Don't extend Configuration
We currently do this so we can use a custom FunctionLibrary
to ensure that search results are regarded as properly in document order.
We could avoid the need for this if we implement a CollectionURIResolver
that handles a few special schemes (like lux:) since results from
collection() are considered to be in document order.
*** DocumentSorter
We also prevent additional sorting of the entire result set in some cases
we can determine it to be unnecessary by providing a custom Optimizer that overrides
Optimizer.makeConditionalDocumentSorter.  This happens, eg when evaluating
a path like exists(//foo//bar).  There is no way around this in Saxon HE,
and it is a significant performance whack for many queries.  We need to test if Saxon PE
and/or EE do a better job of optimization here.
* HTML/HTML5
try reading files using James Clark's fixup parser?  Tag Soup, more likely
- is this built in to Saxon?
* improve compilation speed
XQTS tests run substantially slower with Lux "optimization" since
compilation speed is at least 2x for every expression, and this seems to
dominate the test speed.
** Use Saxon CodeInjector to manipulate the expression tree
Unfortunately this isn't quite feasible because CodeInjector doesn't get
called at enough entry points.  It seemed close?
* word index followthrough
** provide hooks for custom analyzer in QNameAnalyzer/QNameTokenStream
Apply custom analysis chain to each text node, and then wrap in
QNameFilter.
** alternate fields
with different analysis, different element exclusions, different attribute
inclusion rules.  For example there should be a field that includes only
attributes.
* testing for correctness
** develop an XQTS database query test
Ignore queries that use the emptydocument as input Run the other queries
against the entire test set as context: ie against the sequence of
documents that is collection(xqts) and then run using Lux.  Make sure the
results are consistent; compare timing.

I've done this, but it's hard to prove that we're getting the same results
back since the order in which documents are returned from collection()
seems to be a bit unpredictable in Saxon?
** standard function library untested
A bunch of functions are untested.  We don't know if we're doing the right
thing in terms of query generation based on their args.  See
PathOptimizer.fnArgParity
** search test2
refactor and merge w/search test - check opto facts against actual behavior
** search test all index types
include name-index only test
