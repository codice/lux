* better tests generally
** search test coverage
Run search tests for everything in query test, comparing "raw" against
indexed results.
** search test all index types
include name-index only test
** solr search handler coverage
test all atomic result types
* packaging / distribution
** ifpress
Make sure the update handler is compatible?  It keeps existing fields in
place?  Provide a mechanism to notify it about other indexes?

This is going to be a bit confusing if people are used to the existing
system?  It's now XPath only (no sorting)...

*** upload to ifactory maven repo
*** install in loader sandbox
add a dependency on lux; add configuration to schema/solrconfig
update sandbox to exec xpath using lux? use when present
** lucene
mention on the mailing list?
** xml-dev
mention on the mailing list?
* new indexes
** value indexes
** word indexes
** sorting
* cleanup
** delete dead code
*** lux:root()
subsumed by predicate optimization
*** Optimizer
It's suspect and not doing anything anyway
*** get rid of lux:search facts argument
The facts are not serving any purpose now that we are using lazy
evaluation, and we have separate lux:count and lux:exists methods.
** add pagination args to lux:search
This should help work around some of the shortcomings of Saxon's HE
optimizer (re: documentSort) and let us skip document retrieval for docs
prior to the starting doc.

Background: the evaluator has to ensure that sequences of nodes are unique
and in document order.  Our Optimizer calculates and asserts document
order, but doesn't detect when there are multiple copies of the same node.
This can occur due to doc() and root().  Maybe other functions?  A sequence
like //foo/root() returns documents, but the evaluator iterates over nodes
(//foo) in each document, and returns each document once for each
occurrence of foo in its document.

** shorten xml index field names?
to make it easier to type queries.  Maybe make the default field name be
something reasonable, like xml_text?  then use lx_att, lx_elt, lx_path?
* improve tests
** test namespaces and attributes
queries w/namespaces and attributes have not been tested.
Try indexing and retrieving the reader-test documents
* perf test
some kind of comparison with something
* API packaging
** rename Saxon
Lux? Evaluator?
** configuration
*** Lucene field names
*** Object Model
Saxon Xdm vs JDOM vs DOM vs ?
*** language
XPath / XQuery
