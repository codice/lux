* document storage optimization
We considered a lazy-parsed document model where we store the serialized
string, and only parse and construct a Saxon TinyTree as needed.  This
would allow us to optimize the case where we return unprocessed document
nodes from solr.  It's easy, but doesn't optimize very many cases: if you
actually need to execute any xquery at all, there'd be no benefit.

We also considered creating our own document model and wrapping it as a
NodeInfo for integration w/Saxon.  But this is a huge duplicative effort.

In the end, the best solution seems to be: (1) copy and extend TinyTree
with our own binary storage scheme, while at the same time working with
Saxonica to make our extensions compatible with Saxon-PE/EE so we can use
Ptree.
* walk through installation in ifpress
Make sure it's easy to configure.  Check compatibility with pub factory usage
** download jar
from luxproject.net?  I guess we need a web site or something...
** place jar in solr/lib folder
make this a standard part of ifactory's installations
** configure solr plugins
add lux config block to solrconfig.xml; we should provide a little sample
config file.
** configure fields
Configure lux update processor to use "uri" and "xml_text" as its uri and
xml fields.  Test by adding to ifpress-solr/solr, config and run
ifpress-solr tests.  And then perform some searches!
*** field sharing
We are sharing XML storage - great!  We could share full text index as
well, and ultimately we should only need to store one of these fields.  For
the moment we store both because: (1) when highlighting for snippets we
don't want XML tags, and (2) we only want the body in fulltext_t.  Once we
adopt lux, we can search the body in an easier way, fix the highlighting
problem, and do away with fulltext_t I think.
** test usage in ifpress context
* word index followthrough
** provide hooks for custom analyzer in QNameAnalyzer/QNameTokenStream
Apply custom analysis chain to each text node, and then wrap in
QNameFilter.
** full text search *excluding some descendants*
excluded some elements from search: for example the default should exclude
all attributes!!  Currently phrases span attributes!  But wait: "full text"
ie *no qname prefix* does *not* include attributes.  I don't think we need
to change anything here?  Deprioritizing...
** alternate fields
with different analysis, different element exclusions, different attribute
inclusion rules.  For example there should be a field that includes only
attributes.
* testing for correctness
** test queries in complex path relations
** namespace support (in indexes)
This might be working, but we need to test
** attribute index support
This might be working, but we need to test
** develop an XQTS database query test
Ignore queries that use the emptydocument as input Run the other queries
against the entire test set as context: ie against the sequence of
documents that is collection(xqts) and then run using Lux.  Make sure the
results are consistent; compare timing.

I've done this, but it's hard to prove that we're getting the same results
back since the order in which documents are returned from collection()
seems to be a bit unpredictable in Saxon?
** standard function library untested
A bunch of functions are untested.  We don't know if we're doing the right
thing in terms of query generation based on their args.  See
PathOptimizer.fnArgParity
** search test2
refactor and merge w/search test - check opto facts against actual behavior
** search test all index types
include name-index only test
** solr search handler coverage
test all atomic result types
* performance testing
benchmark against MarkLogic, eXist
** Compare indexing speed
** Compare query/eval speed
show impact of parsing, document retrieval?
** Test performance on XQTS with Saxon alone, and with Lux/Saxon
show impact of Lux on compilation speed We did this.  The overall slowdown
on XQTS is a bit depressing: running the entire test suite with Lux enabled
takes about 50% longer than without it.  However this seems largely to be
due to the effect of some tests which, when compiled, lead to expression
trees that are much larger than the original xquery form.  The rule of
thumb seems to be that you can expect compilation time to double.  In XQTS,
compilation time dominates the test (after simply loading test data).

* Bugs
** contain() is over-optimized
We replace it with a search call, but search is *analyzed* (so case is
ignored, etc).
** raise exception when query parse fails
this is currently getting swallowed internally and only printed to stderr
* features
** directory (uri component) index
also link to collection()?
** highlighting
** optimized sorting
** fragmentation 
use Lucene's block join indexing
** support for full set of atomic types
The main thing missing is marshalling results from Solr
* api design / cleanup / documentation
** parseable query
rename and consolidate naming of subclasses
** delete dead code
*** get rid of lux:search facts argument
Note: this is still used to convey boolean-falsehood.
** remove these notes from the release
** make clean package dependencies 
*** fill out the generic API
*** put all the Saxon-specific code in a package
**  Object lifecycle
Saxon currently holds the DocIdAllocator and CachingDocReader, but these
should really be an object with query life-span.  Make sure that long-lived
objects stay in Evaluator (Saxon) and short-lived ones in Context
(SaxonContext).
* optimization ideas
There are a few more things we can optimize using the "basic" indexing setup
** failure to optimize deep path query properly
see the expression in SearchTest.testTrailingStringCall - it ends up
including some booleans instead of all paths
** count(collection())
** optimize not(empty(X)) -> exists(X), and not(exists(X)) -> empty(X)
** simplify some path queries
Sometimes we generate a query like 
w(w(w({},\"PLAY\"),\"PERSONAE\" OR \"ACT\"),\"TITLE\")
instead of
w({},\"PLAY\",(\"ACT\" OR \"PERSONAE\"),\"TITLE\")
Is the second one actually better?
** optimize the Optimizer 
It currently generates an entire translated expression tree for every
subtree it attempts to optimize so that we can figure out if that subtree
is ordered or not.  We could possibly cache a translated tree and walk it
in parallel?  Or link subexpressions to it with some kind of map?
*** cache compiled (optimized) expressions
Where does such a cache belong?
** Path indexes random idea
What if instead of collapsing all the paths down so we only store unique
paths, we retained the document structure in some way by listing *all*
paths?  What would that buy?  numerical predicates?
** pre-evaluate some functions, like aggregates:

In cases where we can do this (argument expression is evaluated in the
QueryContext, ie there is no current node, or the argument is the
collection() function), rewrite/wrap/intercept the function to an internal
method (lux:count) that we implement by recursing into a nested query/eval.

Perform static analysis of the argument expression(s) to see if they can be
retrieved minimally by query.  If we can prove that the db query result
count will equal the expression result count, then we can replace the
count() expression with an (indexed, more efficient) query-count()
expression.  exists() and not() can be computed as count()>0 and count()=0,
and we can short-circuit evaluation in the result collector.

This could also hold for max/min when we have an appropriate field.  Maybe
we can even help out w/aggregates like sum/avg?

More complex would be something like: count(//a) + count(//b) ?

*** root()
*** count()
across multiple documents
*** node-uri(), document-uri()
** optimize pagination when we know that #count=#estimate
optimize subsequence when we can - eg the first arg, the sequence, is
entirely indexed.  And even when it's not, make sure we don't iterate on
beyond where we need to - asserting the results are sorted properly.  We're
somewhat limited in our ability to do this right now since we rely on Saxon
to make judgements about sorting, and it doesn't always optimize as
agressively as we would like, at least not in the saxon-HE version.  It
works in some simple cases, though.
