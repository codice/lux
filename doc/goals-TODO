* Mission
Bring the power of XML to a wider community by fostering a new web
developer ecosystem based on XQuery against an indexed data store.
** analogy to LAMP
Ultimately we can provide an easy-to-use and easy-to-install alternative to
PHP/MySQL for XML document-oriented sites.
** differentiators
Why not Base/X or eXist or one of the other similar techs?  Minimal
approach: leverages best-of-breed indexing and xquery evaluation w/Lucene
and Saxon.  Strong focus on query optimization enables us to provide a very
high quality, high=perfoming system. 
* High-level Goals
** provide optimized XML-aware searching
xpath analysis yielding index operations as much as possible using a
special search function, and by optimizing native xpath operation.
Not XQFT? XQ update?
** compelling use cases
*** analysis of unknown corpus
*** xml-aware queries without index configuration
** learn indexes?
grow xpath; determine salient dimensions by #matches - some, all or none.
** learn storage strategy
chunk documents by size; guided by learned paths
*** reduce parsing/serialization time
*** xpath execution time
