We use maven to build Lux.  We provide a maven pom file; an Eclipse
.project file is also included in the distribution.  

To build a clean distribution, running all unit tests:

cd lux
mvn install (runs tests, packages the jar, and installs in your repo)

cd ../lux-appserver
mvn clean package dependency:copy-dependencies assembly:single

run app server:

./lux  (or ./lux.bat on Windows)
