We use maven to build Lux.  We provide a maven pom file; an Eclipse
.project file is also included in the distribution.  Maven commands we use
when building Lux:

mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn test (runs all unit tests)
mvn install (runs tests builds the jar, and installs in your repo)

mvn jetty:run (runs the app server using jetty)
mvn verify (runs jetty app server, and then integration tests)
mvn assembly:single 

To build a clean distribution, running all unit tests:

cd lux
mvn install (runs tests builds the jar, and installs in your repo)
mvn assembly:single

cd ../lux-appserver
mvn clean package assembly:single
