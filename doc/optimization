For any given optimization, compute a with/without timing comparison across
a range of queries.  In general, we can simply replace the query with *:*
to get a reasonable comparison.

Also compare index sizes



-------------------------------------


How do we show the positive effect of all of this optimization?

For each indexing configuration, 

1) Measure the number of discarded documents

When this is zero, the indexing retrieves only the required documents.

Or equivalently, the ratio of (1+estimate) to (1+count) - 1 being optimal.

2) In the case of expressions that are evaluated without the need to
execute XPath at all (or parse), indicate the relative % of time that would
be taken in parse/XPath.  Of course this would be less with a better
parser/XPath evaluator.
