* Packaging / distribution
What is the goal for a first public release?  Is it better to just get
something out there and invite users / collaboration?  The best thing will
be to make sure whatever we put is out very high quality, and complete
within some limited sphere.  But not to wait too long, since we want to
test our ideas in the marketplace, and start to drum up interest and
support.
** PubFactory
Open up to PF developers; explain what it is (and is not); solicit ideas
for improvements and new directions.  Schedule a demo/presentation at
engineering meeting.
** sourceforge?
At some point we'll want to put this up in a collaboration environment.
Consider Collabnet?  GitHub?  Google Code?
** ifpress

** lucene
mention on the mailing list?
** xml-dev
mention on the mailing list?
** svn
** domain/namespace
lux.* is unavailable
luxpath.net/org are available
** licensing. 
Saxon licensing doesn't seem to be an issue?  Review
Mozilla license, but if we are committed to open source there's no problem?
If we do commit to saxon (seems like the best way to focus on indexing and
query optos?), should probably scrap Jaxen support, or stop extending its
tests.  Already the Lucene and Solr integration is too tied to the specific
impl.  Alternatively, see this as an oppty to build a good abstraction
layer.
* Plans
** benchmark framework
Eventually will want to scale up, perform repeats, report timings in a
better way, etc.  For now unit tests seem fine.
* Advanced Indexing techniques
** index XML structure
"shred" or "fragment" - should help w/large docs.. Additional query
optimizations will be possible (like indexed //foo without the need for any
post-evaluation, joins, etc).
* Saxon integration
** compatible API
Expose some kind of API like Saxon's? Or behave as a Saxon Configuration
plus a preprocessing optimizer?
** PTree binary storage
Use tinytree for storage; evaluate the perf improvement from this.  Could
use Ptree if you have saxon-PE+.  Or could build a replacement (maybe for
in house use, but don't release).  Actually this proves to be difficult
without totally taking over Saxon.
** TinyTree in ifpress
** check whether our code works w/9.1 (Saxon B) ?
* Highlighting
