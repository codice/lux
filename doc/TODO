* Mission
Low-profile optimized xquery data store suitable for embedding, in a java
process, or as a web service. And an app server, but this is really
secondary.

* Plans
* Advanced Indexing techniques
** index XML structure
"shred" or "fragment" - should help w/large docs.. Additional query
optimizations will be possible (like indexed //foo without the need for any
post-evaluation, joins, etc).
* Saxon integration
** compatible API
Expose some kind of API like Saxon's? Or behave as a Saxon Configuration
plus a preprocessing optimizer?
