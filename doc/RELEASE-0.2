Lux is an integration of Lucene/Solr and Saxon that allows you to query
using XPath 2.0 expressions against XML stored in and indexed using Lucene.

XPath expressions are analyzed by the Lux optimizer, which generates a
Lucene query for each absolute sub-expression.  This provides an implicit
collection() context for every query.  The effect is as if the expression
were evaluated against every document in the database, but every effort is
made to avoid retrieving documents that will not ultimately produce any
results.

Known Issues

Only a few functions are optimized. In particular, user-defined functions
inhibit optimizations.
